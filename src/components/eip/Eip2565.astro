  <h4 class="font-semibold">TL;DR</h4>
  <p>
    This EIP reprices the <code>ModExp</code> (modular exponentiation) precompile to more accurately
    reflect its true computational cost. This makes various cryptographic functions that depend on it
    (like VDFs, SNARKs, and accumulators) cheaper and more practical to use on Ethereum.
  </p>

  <h4 class="font-semibold">New Gas Cost Formula</h4>
  <p>
    A new algorithm was introduced to calculate the gas cost, replacing the one from EIP-198. The
    formula is designed to better approximate the complexity of the underlying "bigint" library
    operations.

  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
    <li>
      <strong>Multiplication Complexity:</strong> Approximates the cost of a multiplication, calculated
      as <code>(ceil(max(base_length, modulus_length) / 8))^2</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Iteration Count:</strong> Approximates the number of multiplications needed, based on the
      bit length of the exponent.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="font-semibold">Rationale</h4>
  <p>
    The previous formula from EIP-198 was found to be an inaccurate approximation. The new formula
    better models the performance of modern exponentiation algorithms, and the gas cost is
    calibrated against other precompiles like <code>ECRecover</code> to ensure network security and prevent
    DoS vectors.
