  <h4 class="font-semibold">TL;DR</h4>
  <p>
    This ERC introduces a singleton on-chain registry for storing private, provable statements. It allows users and protocols to anchor commitments (blinded data) to a shared database and later use Zero-Knowledge proofs to verify claims about this data without revealing it. This creates a standardized, reusable foundation for ZK-based identity, reputation, and other privacy-preserving systems.
  </p>

  <h4 class="font-semibold">Specification</h4>
  <p>
    The system is built around a central <code>EvidenceRegistry</code> contract that manages a provable key-value store called <code>EvidenceDB</code>, which is implemented as a Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT).
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
    <li>
      <strong><code>EvidenceRegistry</code>:</strong> A singleton contract that acts as the main entry point. It provides functions like <code>addStatement</code>, <code>removeStatement</code>, and <code>updateStatement</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Namespace Isolation:</strong> Each statement is stored under an isolated key, generated by hashing the sender's address with the provided key. This prevents one registrar from overwriting another's data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Registrars:</strong> Developers can build custom "Registrar" contracts for specific use cases (e.g., identity, proof-of-attendance) that interact with the central registry.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ZK-Friendly:</strong> The standard recommends using ZK-friendly hash functions like Poseidon to make it efficient to generate proofs of inclusion or exclusion for the stored data.
    </li>
