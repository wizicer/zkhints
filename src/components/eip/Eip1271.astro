  <h4 class="font-semibold">TL;DR</h4>
  <p>
    This EIP defines a standard way for smart contracts to verify signatures, enabling them to act
    like externally owned accounts (EOAs) for authentication. Contracts can implement an <code
      >isValidSignature</code
    > function, allowing other contracts to check if a signature is valid on their behalf. This is crucial
    for applications like decentralized exchanges with off-chain order books where smart contract wallets
    need to sign orders.
  </p>

  <h4 class="font-semibold">Specification</h4>
  <p>
    A contract that wishes to be able to sign messages must implement the <code>ERC1271</code> interface,
    which contains a single function:
  </p>
  <pre
    class="p-2 rounded"><code>function isValidSignature(
  bytes32 _hash,
  bytes memory _signature
) public view returns (bytes4 magicValue);</code></pre>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
    <li>
      <strong>Functionality:</strong> When called, this function should return a magic value (<code
        >0x1626ba7e</code
      >) if the signature is valid for the given hash. Otherwise, it should return a different
      value.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>State:</strong> The function must not modify state (it is a <code>view</code> function).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flexibility:</strong> The implementation can use any logic to validate the signature, such
      as checking against a list of authorized signers, using multi-sig logic, or supporting different
      signature schemes.
    </li>
  </ul>
