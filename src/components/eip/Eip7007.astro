  <p>
    This ERC extends ERC-721 to create verifiable AI-Generated Content (AIGC) NFTs. It provides a standard way to prove that a piece of digital content was generated by a specific AI model with a specific prompt, using techniques like Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) or Optimistic Machine Learning (opML). This enables on-chain provenance for AI art and new monetization models for model creators.

  <h4 class="font-semibold">Specification</h4>
  <p>
    The standard introduces a core interface, <code>IERC7007</code>, which must be implemented alongside ERC-721. It includes:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
    <li>
      <strong><code>addAigcData(...)</code>:</strong> A function to associate AI-generated data (the content) and a proof with a token.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><code>verify(...)</code>:</strong> A view function that checks if the AI-generated data is valid for a given prompt and proof. This is where the zkML or opML verification logic resides.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Optional Extensions:</strong> Includes <code>Enumerable</code> for discovering prompts/tokens and <code>Updatable</code> to handle data changes, which is particularly useful in optimistic systems.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mt-2">
    A key design choice is that the <code>tokenId</code> is derived from the hash of the prompt, ensuring that each unique prompt corresponds to a single, unique NFT.
