Commitment schemes are cryptographic primitives that allow a party to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden from others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. They are fundamental building blocks in zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic protocols.

**💡 Key Properties:**

- 🔒 **Binding**: The committer cannot change the committed value after the commitment is made.
- 🔍 **Hiding**: The commitment does not reveal information about the committed value.

Commitment schemes are essential for many cryptographic protocols, especially in zero-knowledge proofs where a prover needs to commit to certain values without revealing them immediately. They provide a way to "lock" a value in a way that can be verified later.
