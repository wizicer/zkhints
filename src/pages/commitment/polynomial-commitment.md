A univariate polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) is a commitment scheme for the message space $\mathbb{F}^{\leq d}[X]$, the ring of univariate polynomials with maximum degree $d \in \mathbb{N}$ and coefficients in the field $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{Z}_{p}$

It supports an argument of knowledge for proving the correct evaluation of a committed polynomial at a given point. A lot of information can be encoded in a polynomial: an arbitrary relation can be represented as a polynomial.
