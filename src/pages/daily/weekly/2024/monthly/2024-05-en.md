### 2024.5.22

**[Papers]**

- Jens Groth (of Groth16 fame) and co-authors present “Fast Batched Asynchronous Distributed Key Generation,” introducing asynchronous secret sharing and super-invertible matrix techniques to improve communication and computation for threshold Schnorr signatures in asynchronous networks.
