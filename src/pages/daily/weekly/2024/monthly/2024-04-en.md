**[Papers]**

- 3MI Labs and Ulvetanna collaborate in the paper “Vision Mark-32: ZK-Friendly Hash Function Over Binary Tower Fields,” proposing a special construction over binary tower fields and achieving a fully pipelined FPGA implementation. Experiments show an order-of-magnitude improvement over Poseidon hashing.
  *Note: The paper is also a good primer on binary tower fields.*
  [Paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/633)

- Alqahtani et al. propose PBP-LEMs, a privacy-preserving billing protocol for local energy markets, in their paper “Privacy-Preserving Billing for Local Energy Markets.”
  *Note: This is an example of ZKP in a real application scenario.*
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15886)

- Sun et al. introduce zkLLM in “zkLLM: Zero Knowledge Proofs for Large Language Models,” a system that verifies the correctness of LLM outputs using the sumcheck protocol. It produces proofs under 200 kB and can attest to a 1.3B-parameter model within 15 minutes.
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16109)

- Barthoulot et al. redefine cryptographic accumulators in “Cryptographic Accumulators: New Definitions, Enhanced Security, and Delegatable Proofs,” adding a “privately evaluated unforgeability” property that bolsters security against forgery attacks.
  *Note: Accumulators can replace the widely used Merkle Tree in certain contexts, drawing significant attention.*

- A launch post for Ligetron, a zkML framework built on Ligero. For 440 million floating-point instructions and 3 billion integer instructions, the prover runs for roughly 14 hours (50,000 seconds) while the verifier runs for 6.5 hours (22,000 seconds). The resulting proof is about 10 GB in length and peak memory usage.
  *Note: The code has not been open sourced.*
